# Master's thesis in Control of PDEs.

Master 2 in Applied Mathematics at Lebanese International University.

The title of this thesis is "Stability of a Timoshenko system with local Kevin - Voigt damping"

The main contribution in this work is the proof of the well-posedness of the considered problem
with only one source of damping as well as proving the strong stability still holds in this case.
